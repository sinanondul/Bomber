                                First decide who gets to be player 1 and who gets to be player 2 \n\n
                                Next choose your characters and names accordingly\n\n
                                When the board is st up, click on Dice to roll dice\n\n
                                Player 1 Starts first\n\n
                                Player moves the number of blocks according to number on dice\n\n
                                Landing on a snake head means youre bitten and fall down the snake\n\n
                                Landing at the bottom of a vine means you swing up to the block at the end of the vine\n\n
                                Landing on the anti-venom means that for one go you are immune to a snakes bite\n\n
                                Falling in the oil pit renders you incapable to swing up the vine for one go\n\n
                                Landing on a banana would result you slipping upto three blocks infron or three blocks back\n\n
                                Landing on another player would mean that you beat the other player three blocks back\n\n
                                You win the game by reaching block 100 and thus surviving the jungle!\n\n
