# Bomber

This project is intended for Bilkent University's CS 319 course. Bomber is a Java based game where the objective is to control a character through a series of maps avoiding objects. The basic concept is that you're an astroid and have to avoid celestrial objects and eventually crash into earth. This game is based on sarcastic satire and the main objective is to crash into earth. 

The game is still in its protoype stage and is bound to change.
