Jungle Pursuit is a replica of the board game Snakes and Ladders. We are planning to
develop Jungle Pursuit with different features, images and with a slightly different gameplay
that we remember from Snakes and Ladders. The game is meant to revolve around a
jungle-like theme and hence the images that we choose will be appropriate for such a theme.
Our game is played by 1 or 2 players, rolling a dice in each turn to move their
character. The path to victory consists of 100 squares and the goal is to reach 100th square.
There will be similarities with Snakes and Ladders like Vine Branches as Ladders to move
up, Snakes that eat the character and move the character backwards, some bonuses that
move the character onwards or backwards randomly and shields that protect the character
getting bit by a snake.
The game is still in its protoype stage and is bound to change.
